Assignment name: 
TCSS 305: Programming Practicum, Autumn 2024

Name: Tianyi Huang
UWNetID: huangtyi


Assignment Overview:
(Describe your understanding of the purpose and scope of the assignment in 250 words or less. The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over. Do not just copy text from the assignment description.)

In this assignment, I am suppose to develop a graphical paint application, demonstrating my understanding of key programming concepts such as 2D graphics, event-driven programming, and user interface design with Swing components. The program aims to replicate basic functionalities of a drawing tool, allowing users to create and manipulate graphical elements like lines, rectangles, ellipses, and freehand drawings with adjustable settings such as color and thickness.

Resources and Collaborations:
(List all resources used during the development of this assignment other than materials published on Canvas or found in the course Java reference book.
Also list the names of any students whom you collaborated with during the development of this assignment.
If you only used materials from Canvas and the course Java reference and did no collaboration with others during this assignment you can just say 'none' below.)

I was completing this assignment with Zhiheng Wang's help (he is completing his master degree in computer science in USC), he had couple inspiration to me on how to achieve some of the functions. 

Technical Impression:
(Describe what you have done to complete the assignment in 200-500 words. The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over; however, summaries that do not meet the minimum length requirement or are trivial in nature (representing little thought or effort) will not get full credit. You can share your personal experiences, things that particularly frustrated you about the assignment, things that particularly interested you about the assignment, etc. It is especially important that you document any difficulties you had with tools, Java libraries, etc.)

To complete the assignment, I began by thoroughly reviewing the instructions document to understand the requirements, including the GUI layout, tools, and expected behaviors. I set up the provided starter files in Eclipse, organized them, and followed the design pattern to ensure clean architecture. I focused on building the graphical interface first, implementing the PaintGUI and DrawingPanel classes for the main window and drawing area, and adding features like a menu bar, toolbar, and sliders. Developing the drawing tools (line, rectangle, ellipse, and pencil) was both interesting and challenging, particularly managing mouse events and ensuring shapes were drawn correctly in all directions. Synchronizing the toolbar buttons with menu options using the Action interface was frustrating at first but ultimately rewarding as it streamlined behavior management. While debugging mouse events and ensuring synchronization between UI components tested my patience, I found the process of designing a tool hierarchy and customizing the interface particularly engaging. This assignment reinforced my understanding of modular design, Java Swing, and event-driven programming.

Unresolved problems in my submission:
(Use this space to list problems which you know exist in your submission. This could include program features which you did not have time to implement, bugs in your code, warnings generated by the tools which you did not understand or did not have time to correct, or other issues. I give a reduced grade penalty for problems which I find in your submission that are listed here and a larger penalty for those which are not. Just say 'none' if there are no issues that you are aware of.) 

There are still about 20 warnings there, I will try to avoid them in the next submition.


Questions:
(Use this space to ask questions that you still have about the assignment, or just say 'none' if you have no questions at this time.)

None
