Assignment Overview:
(Describe your understanding of the purpose and scope of the assignment in 250 words or less. The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over. Do not just copy text from the assignment description.)

The purpose of Assignment 6C is to enhance the existing Paint program by introducing new features and refining its user interface. The assignment requires adding a 'Background...' menu option to set the drawing panel's background color, and an 'Undo' button to the toolbar, enabling users to remove the most recently drawn shapes dynamically. The interface must include a menu bar with adjustable thickness settings, color selection options, and tool choices for drawing lines, rectangles, ellipses, and freehand sketches. Additionally, features like the 'Undo' and 'Clear' buttons must respond dynamically based on the state of the drawing, becoming enabled or disabled accordingly.

Resources and Collaborations:
(List all resources used during the development of this assignment other than materials published on Canvas or found in the course Java reference book.
Also list the names of any students whom you collaborated with during the development of this assignment.
If you only used materials from Canvas and the course Java reference and did no collaboration with others during this assignment you can just say 'none' below.)

Technical Impression:
(Describe what you have done to complete the assignment in 200-500 words. The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over; however, summaries that do not meet the minimum length requirement or are trivial in nature (representing little thought or effort) will not get full credit. You can share your personal experiences, things that particularly frustrated you about the assignment, things that particularly interested you about the assignment, etc. It is especially important that you document any difficulties you had with tools, Java libraries, etc.)

To complete Assignment 6C, I built upon the foundation of my previous work in parts A and B of the Paint program, adding the new features and refinements as specified. I began by implementing the 'Background...' menu option, which required integrating a new JColorChooser specifically for the background color. This part was particularly satisfying because it showcased how modular and reusable code design can simplify adding distinct functionalities. Setting up the 'Undo' button in the toolbar proved to be more challenging, as it required careful management of the shapes list and ensuring the button's state updated dynamically based on user actions. Debugging this functionality was a bit frustrating, especially when I encountered edge cases like handling the button state when all shapes were undone or when new shapes were drawn after clearing.
I also worked on refining the GUI, ensuring that the slider for thickness worked as expected with appropriate tick marks and an intuitive initial value. Fine-tuning the behavior of the 'Undo' and 'Clear' buttons to align with the requirements was an engaging problem, as it forced me to think critically about event-driven programming and state management. I particularly enjoyed creating the Help menu, as it allowed for a personal touch in presenting the program details.
Overall, while some aspects of the assignment were tedious—such as ensuring all components behaved consistently under various user inputs—the process of seeing the final product come together was incredibly rewarding. It reinforced the importance of thoughtful design and systematic testing in creating user-friendly software. This assignment challenged me to think holistically about both functionality and user experience, which made completing it a fulfilling experience.


Unresolved problems in my submission:
(Use this space to list problems which you know exist in your submission. This could include program features which you did not have time to implement, bugs in your code, warnings generated by the tools which you did not understand or did not have time to correct, or other issues. I give a reduced grade penalty for problems which I find in your submission that are listed here and a larger penalty for those which are not. Just say 'none' if there are no issues that you are aware of.) 

I tried my best to get rid of the warnings.
